# Evaluating Companiesâ€™ Information Privacy Policy

This is the final project for CMU course 94775 Unstructured Data Analysis (Spring 2020).

In this project, we would like to decompose companies' data privacy policy and understand them through the lens of specific categories. We would connect the dots between what people are concerned about and what companies collect, hoping to create more transparency in company privacy policies. We are interested in the following questions:

1. Do people express special concerns towards certain data privacy practices on social media?
2. How do companies' privacy policies vary from each other? Can we spot any clusters of companies?
3. Can we identify any categories/topics in the privacy policies?

We mainly employed three machine learning methods: KMeans Clustering, LDA Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis. Below is the analysis pipeline.
